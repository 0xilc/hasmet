# This is the configuration file for the Clang-Tidy linter.
# It defines which checks to run and how to configure them.
# The file format is YAML.

# The 'Checks' key specifies which checks to enable or disable.
# We start by disabling all checks ('-*') and then selectively enable groups.
# This is a robust way to ensure you only run the checks you want.
Checks: '
  -*,
  bugprone-*,
  cppcoreguidelines-*,
  modernize-*,
  performance-*,
  readability-*
'

# 'CheckOptions' allows you to fine-tune the behavior of specific checks.
# This is useful for customizing rules to fit your project's style.
CheckOptions:
  # --- Naming Conventions ---
  # Enforce a consistent naming style. This is one of the most valuable checks.
  # We will use CamelCase for types and lower_case for variables/functions.
  - key: readability-identifier-naming.ClassCase
    value: CamelCase
  - key: readability-identifier-naming.StructCase
    value: CamelCase
  - key: readability-identifier-naming.FunctionCase

  - key: readability-identifier-naming.VariableCase
    value: lower_case
  - key: readability-identifier-naming.MemberCase

  # --- Disabling Noisy Checks ---
  # Don't require member initializers for plain C-style arrays.

# 'HeaderFilterRegex' is crucial. It tells Clang-Tidy which files to analyze.
# We set it to analyze only headers within our own 'src' directory.
# This prevents it from linting system headers (e.g., <vector>) or external libraries.
HeaderFilterRegex: 'src/.*'

# 'ExtraArgs' lets you pass command-line arguments to the Clang compiler instance
# that Tidy uses to parse your code. Ensuring the C++ standard matches your
# project is very important.
ExtraArgs: ['-std=c++17']
